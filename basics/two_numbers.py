# Create a program that prints a few operations on two numbers: 22 and 13

# Print the result of 13 added to 22

# Print the result of 13 substracted from 22

# Print the result of 22 multiplied by 13

# Print the result of 22 divided by 13 (as a decimal fraction)

# Print the integer part of 22 divided by 13

# Print the remainder of 22 divided by 13


x = 13
y = 22

print("x = " + str(x))
print("y = " + str(y))
print("x + y = " + str(x + y))
print("x - y = " + str(x - y))
print("x * y = " + str(x * y))
print("y / x = " + str(y / x))
print("y // x = " + str(y // x))
print("y % x = " + str(y % x))
